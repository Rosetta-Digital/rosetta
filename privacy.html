          </p>
          <p>
            Even if we delete your Data, it may persist on backup or archival media for legal, tax or regulatory purposes.

        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not satisfied with the way a complaint you make in relation to your Data is handled by us, you may be able to refer your complaint to the relevant data protection authority. For the UK, this is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The ICO's contact details can be found on their website at https://ico.org.uk/.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important that the Data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Data changes during the period for which we hold it.
        </p>

        <h4>Transfers outside the European Economic Area </h4>
        <p>
          Data which we collect from you may be stored and processed in and transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). For example, this could occur if our servers are located in a country outside the EEA or one of our service providers is situated in a country outside the EEA. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only transfer Data outside the EEA where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data, eg by way of data transfer agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission, or by signing up to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, in the event that the organisation in receipt of the Data is based in the United States of America.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure that your Data receives an adequate level of protection, we have put in place appropriate safeguards and procedures with the third parties we share your Data with. This ensures your Data is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with the Data Protection Laws.
        </p>
        <h4>Links to other websites </h4>
        <p>
          This Website may, from time to time, provide links to other websites. We have no control over such websites and are not responsible for the content of these websites. This privacy policy does not extend to your use of such websites. You are advised to read the privacy policy or statement of other websites prior to using them.
        </p>
        <h4>Changes of business ownership and control</h4>
        <p>
          Rosetta Digital may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business and this may involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of Rosetta Digital. Data provided by Users will, where it is relevant to any part of our business so transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this privacy policy, be permitted to use the Data for the purposes for which it was originally supplied to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also disclose Data to a prospective purchaser of our business or any part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the above instances, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring your privacy is protected.
